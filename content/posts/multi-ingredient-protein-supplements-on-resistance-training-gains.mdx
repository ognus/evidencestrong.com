Summary of a review on effect of protein supplementation and resistance training on fat free mass gains, fat mass, and strength gains.

## Who

1387 healthy persons (361 females) aged 46 (&plusmn;21) years.

## Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials.

Trials of at least 6 weeks duration, resistance training performed at least 2 times per week, no calorie restriction.

<Info topic="multi-ingredient protein supplement">
  protein supplement with any additional ingredients added (eg, carbohydrate
  (CHO), Cr, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB), leucine (Leu), calcium, vit D
  and/or PUFAs)"
</Info>

## Outcome measures/tests

- body composition: total body mass, fat free mass, fat mass
- performance: 1-repetition maximum (1RM)

## Main results

- Multi-ingredient protein supplementation with resistance training increased fat-free mass without increasing fat mass when compared to all the other conditions. Also, multi-ingredient protein supplementation with prolonged resistance training increased the upper body and lower body 1RMs comparing to all the other conditions.
- When multi-ingredient protein supplementation was compared with protein-only supplementation, fat mass increased without changes in total body mass, free-fat mass, upper or lower body 1RMs.
- There was significant heterogeneity in both comparisons for fat-free mass.
- When the differences in outcomes between young or older adults (>45 years) were investigated, the younger population observed no difference in upper body 1RM, and older adults no difference for lower 1RM was found.
- When trained persons were compared against untrained individuals, trained had no effect on fat-free mass or lower body 1RM, untrained had no difference in lower and upper body 1RMs but increased their fat-free mass.
- Protein supplements containing creatine (4 studies) increased on average fat-free mass by 1 kg, when compared with protein only supplements.

<Summary>
  <ForWho label="For a clinician">
    Multi-ingredient protein supplementation increase fat-free mass and 1RM
    gains when combined with resistant training of 6 to 78 weeks.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For a parent">
    Protein supplementation combined with creatine may improve gains in fat-free
    mass and strength in strength training people.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For an athlete">
    Combining protein with creatine may improve your muscle and strength gains
    when training.

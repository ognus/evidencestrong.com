Summary of a study looking at the effect of moderate testosterone increase
on performance in active healthy women.

<Info topic="Testosterone">
  a hormone; males have 15 times higher circulating concentration of this
  hormone than females; normal female levels 0.1-1.8 nmol/L, normal male levels
  7.7-29.4 nmol/L
</Info>

## Who

48 healthy physically active women (Sweden).

<Table>
  <Cell header>Testosterone group</Cell>
  <Cell>24 women aged 28.4 (&plusmn;3.2)</Cell>
  <Cell header>Placebo group</Cell>
  <Cell>24 women aged 28.4 (&plusmn;4.3)</Cell>
  <Cell footer>mean (SD)</Cell>
</Table>

## Design

Randomised double-blinded (participants, assessors) controlled trial.

<Study>
  <Group label="Testosterone group">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Testosterone cream 10 mg (1 mL) (Andro-Feme 1) applied every evening to
        the upper outer thigh for 10 weeks
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
  <Group label="Placebo group">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Placebo cream (1 mL) applied every evening to the upper outer thigh for
        10 weeks
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
</Study>

## Main results

- Serum levels of testosterone increased to 4.3 nmol/L in the Testosterone group (from 0.9 nmol/L).
- Also, the Testosterone group had increased total lean mass, lower limbs lean mass, and running time to exhaustion when compared with the Placebo group.
- No difference between the groups in haemoglobin concentration, fat percentage, spinal bone mineral density, oxygen uptake, average power in the Wingate test, squat jump, countermovement jump, and isokinetic knee extension peak torque.
- Adverse events included increased acne, body hair growth, and menstrual disturbances (ie, prolonged cycles). Return to normal took 4 months after study completion.
- All women finished the study and adherence to the treatment was good.

## Take home message

<Summary>
  <ForWho label="For a clinician">
    Moderate increase in circulating testosterone caused a significant increase
    in aerobic running time, total lean body mass, and lower limb lean mass.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For a parent">
    Differences in performance between men and women in athletic performance are
    likely related to differences in testosterone hormone levels.

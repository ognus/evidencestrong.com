Summary: CORE training was effective in improving strength endurance and foam rolling improved range of motion in recreational athletes over 8 weeks.

## Who

40 recreationally active (2-3 times per week) men and women (Austria).

<Table>
  <Cell header>Foam rolling (FR) group</Cell>
  <Cell>14 athletes aged 30.5 (&plusmn;10.2)</Cell>
  <Cell header>Core stabilisation (CS) group</Cell>
  <Cell>14 athletes aged 28.2 (&plusmn;7.8)</Cell>
  <Cell header>Control group</Cell>
  <Cell>12 athletes aged 29.1 (&plusmn;6.9)</Cell>
  <Cell footer>mean (SD)</Cell>
</Table>

## Design

Randomised controlled trial.

<Study>
  <Group label="Foam rolling (FR) group">
    <p>
      Rolling with pressure (mild to moderate pain acceptable): calf muscles
      quadriceps femoris hamstrings iliotibial band and gluteal muscles 3 sets
      with 1-minute rest home training progression after week 4 2 sessions per
      week for 8 weeks
    </p>
  </Group>
  <Group label="Core stabilisation (CS) group">
    <p>
      5 exercises performed while maintaining a neutral position of the spine:
      front plank back bridge side plank quadruped raising arm and leg
      diagonally and back extension 3 sets per exercise home training
      progression after week 4 2 sessions per week for 8 weeks
    </p>
  </Group>
  <Group label="Control group">
    <p>usual training</p>
  </Group>
</Study>

## Outcome measures/tests

Bourban trunk muscle strength test (strength endurance: ventral, lateral and dorsal muscle chains), standing long jump test, single-leg triple hop for distance, Y-balance test, stand and reach test

## Main results

- 36/40 athletes completed the study. Intervention groups did on average 15 training sessions within 8 weeks.
- Strength endurance: dorsal TMS test result has improved in CORE group compared with no changes in FOAM and CG. No effect in ventral and lateral Bourban trunk muscle strength test was found.
- Range of motion (stand and reach test) improved in FOAM compared to CG, but no differences between FOAM and CORE and CORE and CG.
- No effect of an intervention on standing long jump and single-leg triple hop for distance.
- No effect on balance (Y-balance test).

## Take home message

<Summary>
  <ForWho label="For a clinician">
    Strength endurance improved with CORE training and range of motion improved
    in FOAM rolling group in adult recreational athletes.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For a parent">
    Adult recreational athletes can improve their strength endurance with
    specific CORE training and range of motion with a specific protocol of foam
    rolling.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For an athlete">
    If you are an adult recreational athlete, you could improve your strength
    endurance with specific CORE training and your range of motion with a
    specific protocol of foam rolling.
  </ForWho>

Summary of a study testing injury prevention programme for adult recreational tennis players.

## Who

579 adult recreational tennis players.

<Table>
  <Cell header>Intervention group</Cell>
  <Cell>286 players (female: 157, male: 129)</Cell>
  <Cell>aged 41 (&plusmn;12)</Cell>
  <Cell header>Control group</Cell>
  <Cell>293 players (female: 149, male: 144)</Cell>
  <Cell>aged 42 (&plusmn;13)</Cell>
  <Cell footer>mean (SD)</Cell>
</Table>

## Design

Randomised controlled trial.

<Study>
  <Group label="Intervention group">
    <p>
      The <em>TennisReady</em> injury prevention programme accessed through a
      smartphone app:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        cardiovascular, neuromuscular, tennis-specific exercises (on-court and
        off-court choice)
      </li>
      <li>non-supervised ("home"-based)</li>
      <li>12 weeks</li>
      <li>7-10 minutes per session</li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
  <Group label="Control group">
    <ul>
      <li>trained as usual</li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
</Study>

## Injury measures

Injury survey sent every 2 weeks over 16 weeks of study and asked for:
- number of hours playing tennis,
- injury location,
- injury type,
- time loss (number of days not able to train),
- injuries on modified Oslo Sports and Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) Questionnaire.

## Main results

- The intervention group had an overall injury prevalence of 37% vs 38% in the control group (no difference).
- The overall incidence of injuries was 25.4/1000 hours of tennis exposure in the intervention group vs 24.4/1000 in the control group (no difference).
- Time loss was 5.6 days in the intervention group vs 6.3 days in the control group (statistically significant, but not clinically relevant).
- 8% of participants could be classified as having high-adherence. Compered with low-adherence, there was no difference in injury prevalence.

## Take home message

<Summary>
  <ForWho label="For a clinician">
    <em>TennisReady</em> is the first "home"-based tennis-specific intervention
    but was not successful in reducing injury prevalence. Could be useful if
    performed under supervision.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For a parent">
    <em>TennisReady</em> injury prevention programme could be useful if
    performed regularly and under the coach's supervision.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For an athlete">
    Ask your coach about the usefulness of <em>TennisReady</em> for you.
  </ForWho>

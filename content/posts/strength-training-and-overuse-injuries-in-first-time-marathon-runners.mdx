Summary of an article testing the effect of strength exercises on the rate of overuse injuries in the first-time runners.

## Who

720 first-time New York City Marathon runners aged above 18 years (USA).

<Table>
  <Cell header>Strength training group</Cell>
  <Cell>352 athletes (female: 245, male: 107)</Cell>
  <Cell>aged 35.4 (&plusmn;9.1)</Cell>
  <Cell>BMI 24.2 (&plusmn;4.1)</Cell>
  <Cell header>Control group</Cell>
  <Cell>368 athletes (female: 255, male: 113)</Cell>
  <Cell>aged 36.3 (&plusmn;9.8)</Cell>
  <Cell>BMI 24.0 (&plusmn;3.3)</Cell>
  <Cell footer>mean (SD)</Cell>
</Table>

## Design

Randomized controlled trial of an e-intervention.

<Study>
  <Group label="Strength training group">
    <ul>
      <li>
        10 minutes video + handout with exercises focusing on strength of core,
        hip abductor, and quadriceps in beginners and advanced versions
      </li>
      <li>3 times per week for 12 weeks</li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
  <Group label="Control group">
    <ul>
      <li>trained by themselves</li>
      <li>no restriction of strength training</li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
</Study>

## Outcome measures

- repeated surveys (every two weeks) of injuries (minor, major), overuse injuries
- marathon finishing time

## Main results

- Runners performed the strength training on average 2 (&plusmn;1.2) times per week.
- The average finishing time was 5h 1.1minutes (60.4 minutes) in the strength training group and 4h 57.5 minutes (54.4 minutes) in the control group (no difference).
- There was no difference in major injuries between the groups.
- Most overuse injuries happen in the training 6 to 2 weeks before the race. These injuries were: bone stress injuries (20), tendon/fascia injuries (11), joint injuries (9), muscle injuries (9) and 3 unspecified.
- No difference in minor injuries during training period between groups. 46.3% of runners in the strength training group and 50.5% in control group got at least one injury during the study.
- No difference in minor injuries during the race: 14.7% in strength training group and 16.1% in the control group.
- When compliant (strength training 2 times per week) and non-compliant runners from the strength training group were compared, the compliant runners had a lower incidence of minor injuries (41.5% vs 56.2%). Compliant runners ran slower (5h 2.7 minutes vs 4h 58.2 minutes) and had higher incidence of major injuries (9.1% vs 8.0%).

## Take home message

<Summary>
  <ForWho label="For a clinician">
    This strength training was effective in reducing minor injuries, but not
    major injuries. No improvement in the marathon completion time was found.

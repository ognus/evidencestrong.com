These four exercises are effective in preventing substantial injuries in
orienteerers if performed at least twice a week.

## Who

62 adult male and female elite orienteerers (Sweden).

  <Cell>30 people (female: 15, male: 15)</Cell>

## Design

Randomised controlled trial.

<Study>
  <Group label="Intervention group">
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 exercises on neuromuscular control, balance, jumping:
        <ul>
          <li>one-leg stance</li>
          <li>runner's pose</li>
          <li>one leg heel raise</li>
          <li>one leg side hope (3 difficulty levels)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>progressed every 2 weeks</li>
      <li>4 times a week</li>
      <li>14 weeks</li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
  <Group label="Control group">
    <ul>
      <li>trained as usual</li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
</Study>

## Injury measures

A number of substantial lower limb injuries (from foot to hip), average substantial injury prevalence, the incidence of ankle sprains.

<Info topic="substantial injury">
  injury resulting in a moderate or severe reduction in training volume or performance, or ceasing of training
</Info>

Injury data were collected using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Overuse Injury Questionnaire sent every 2 weeks (via text message) for 14 weeks. Also asked about training volume, frequency of exercises and ankle sprains occurrence.

## Main results

- 64 substantial injuries happened over 14 weeks. 66% during a competitive season. 55% of injuries were in the foot, 22% in the lower leg.
- No significant difference between intervention and control groups for the number of substantial injuries or number of ankle sprains.
- But when participants from the intervention group were divided into high (2 or more times per week) and low compliance (less than 2) sub-groups, there was a significant difference in substantially injured orienteerers with 65% reduced injury risk, and a number of substantial injuries with 64% reduced injury risk, between control and high compliance sub-group, respectively.
- No significant differences occurred between control and low compliance sub-group. In the intervention group, a significantly higher proportion of low compliance orienteerers were injured than high complying orienteerers.

## Take home message

<Summary>
  <ForWho label="For a clinician">
    Only high compliance with the exercise programme gave reduction in injuries.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For a parent">
    Doing these 4 exercises at least 2 times per week can be effective in
    reducing injuries in orienteering.
  </ForWho>
  <ForWho label="For an athlete">
    Perform these 4 exercises at least 2 times per week if you want to prevent
    leg and foot injuries resulting from orienteeting.

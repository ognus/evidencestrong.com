471 community-level floorball athletes aged between 12 to 17 (Sweden).

<Info topic="floorball">
  a form of hockey with 5 players and a goalkeeper; played in 68 countries

## Design

Cluster randomised controlled trial.

<Info topic="cluster">
  all teams from the same club were randomised to be in the same group
</Info>
<Study>
  <Group label="Intervention group">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Running warm-up and the <i>Knee Control</i> injury prevention programme:
        lower limb and core strength, neuromuscular control, balance, jumping
        and landing.
      </li>
      <li>
        10-15 minutes used before each training session in-season (and running
        component used before each game)
      </li>
      <li>on average 1.45 (&plusmn;1.02) sessions per week</li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
  <Group label="Control group">
    <ul>
      <li>trained as usual</li>
    </ul>
  </Group>
</Study>

## Main results

- There were 349 unique injuries in 222 athletes (47%) during the study.
- The intervention group had a 35% lower incidence of all injuries and a 45% lower incidence of acute injuries compared with the control group.
- There was no difference in overuse injuries.
- Females in the intervention group had a higher prevalence of knee injuries compared to the control group. Most of these knee injuries were overuse injuries.
- Compliance with intervention programme was on average 84% (range 13 - 100%) (F: 83% M: 85%).
